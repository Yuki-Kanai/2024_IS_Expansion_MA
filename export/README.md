## Example Output

Output data of the main codes are provided in the `export` directory.
The .png version of the figures of the analysis are found in the notebooks.
Note that the outputs of the .ipynb files do not necessarily direct this directory.
I manually moved the outputs to this directory for sharing the results.

- `multiple_runs11`: Output of `SyRI_IS.py` and `classify_IS_events.py`. Mainly by `*_01_multiple_runs.ipynb`.
- `data`: Output of other ipynbs.
